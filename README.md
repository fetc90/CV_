## Francesca Chater 

I am a software engineer with a background in marketing and PR. During my previous role, I got to play around with some code by chance and was immediately drawn in by the challenge of the logic. The more I practised, I saw how creative writing code could be and I was hooked. So I took the plunge, quit everything, and retrained in software development at Makers Academy, a highly selective coding bootcamp.

### Experience
**UK Community and Content Lead, Sport Heroes Group** (May ‘17 - December ‘18) <br>
I managed the UK community of 100,000 members for a tech start-up. This included researching and writing the weekly newsletter, building Facebook ads and campaign reports from Google Analytics, outsourcing and leading the content team and managing the campaigns from start to finish for major sports brands. This offered a much larger range of technologies and I was energised by the challenge of learning how to use the different software. After having the chance to play around with an HTML template in Dreamweaver for the weekly newsletter, I realised how much I wanted to learn how to write code. It offered the logic and clarity that had attracted me to accounting during my previous role, while also incorporating a huge amount of creativity.

**Account Manager, tpr Media** (August ‘15 - April ‘17) <br>
In a team of three, we built publicity campaigns for clients including the BBC and Channel 4, spanning across all media outlets. I quickly became interested in the accounts and migrated the excel sheet system over to an accounting software called FreeAgent. This consolidated all financial matters, including invoices, business expenses, cash receipts and from there I was able to calculate the tax that was owed. I cancelled unnecessary subscriptions, highlighted overcharges, and dramatically reduced the hours paid for an accountant, saving the founder and CEO considerable money. As a direct result of this, I considered studying accountancy. I liked the clarity it offered and the potential to help people understand what was happening with their money.

**Content Producer, YPlan** (October ‘14 - June ‘15) <br>
_YPlan_, an events app now owned by _Time Out_, was the fastest-growing tech start-up during the time I worked there, with over a million downloads. I manually built the events in the CRM database and wrote the content advertising the London offers. This was my first exposure working with software developers and I always deeply respected them because they knew what could be built and how to build it.
